# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend server

Backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. The file that contains the backend code is app.js. RUN "node app.js" to start the server.

## INFO about app

This application is used as a client for a RDF4J server, so this application is outsourcing the information stored in that server. I used SPARQL queries to get data from the database and to show it on the page.
